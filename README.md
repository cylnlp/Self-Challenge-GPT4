# Patterns Summarized by Llama-3-70B-instruct

## 1: Misleading context with a provided date

This pattern involves providing irrelevant information that can distract GPT-4 from the actual question being asked. The irrelevant information might be presented as a statement or a fact that is not directly related to the question.

Example: Question 2 ("Yesterday, Jan 21, 2011, Jane ate 2 pizzas and 5 wings. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?")

Analysis: The statement about Jane eating pizzas and wings is irrelevant to the question being asked, but GPT-4 might focus on the date mentioned in the statement (Jan 21, 2011) and use it as the reference point for calculating the date one week ago.

Suggestions for generating questions:

Include a statement or fact that is not directly related to the question being asked.
Make sure the irrelevant information contains a date or time reference that can be misinterpreted by GPT-4.
Use a format like "Yesterday/Tomorrow, [date], [irrelevant information]. [actual question]"

## 2: Irrelevant information with a date

This pattern involves providing irrelevant information that includes a date, which might distract GPT-4 from the actual question being asked.
GPT-4 might focus on the date mentioned in the irrelevant information and use it as the reference point for calculations.
Analysis: This pattern challenges GPT-4's ability to separate relevant from irrelevant information and to focus on the actual question being asked.
To generate questions using this pattern:

Provide irrelevant information that includes a date.
Use phrases like "Jane ate 2 pizzas and 5 wings" to create a distraction from the actual question.
Ask a question that requires calculating a date based on the current date, rather than the date mentioned in the irrelevant information.
Example: "Yesterday, John watched a movie on 02/20/2022. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?"

## 3: Lack of explicit current date

This pattern involves not providing an explicit current date, but instead providing a date that is related to the current date (e.g., yesterday's date or tomorrow's date).
GPT-4 might struggle to determine the current date and use the provided date as the reference point for calculations.
Analysis: This pattern challenges GPT-4's ability to infer the current date from the context and to recognize the significance of the phrase "today".
To generate questions using this pattern:

Provide a date that is related to the current date (e.g., yesterday's date or tomorrow's date).
Do not provide an explicit current date.
Ask a question that requires calculating a date based on the current date.
Example: "Yesterday was 06/15/2023. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?"

## 4: Inconsistent or implicit information

This pattern involves providing inconsistent or implicit information about the current date, which might lead GPT-4 to make incorrect assumptions.
GPT-4 might struggle to properly process and utilize the information about the current date.
Analysis: This pattern challenges GPT-4's ability to handle inconsistent or implicit information and to make correct inferences.
To generate questions using this pattern:

Provide inconsistent or implicit information about the current date.
Use phrases like "today could not be" to create a context that requires inference.
Ask a question that requires calculating a date based on the current date.
Example: "Yesterday was 12/31/1929. Today could not be 12/32/1929 because December has only 31 days. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?"

These patterns can help create questions that challenge GPT-4's ability to process and understand dates, and can be used to evaluate its performance in various scenarios.

## 5: Assumption of Existence
